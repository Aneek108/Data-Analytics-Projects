# Flight Delay Prediction Analysis

Several factors contribute to flight delays, including adverse weather conditions, air traffic congestion, mechanical failures, and airline-specific inefficiencies. 
Understanding these causes through data-driven approaches can help airlines optimize scheduling, improve efficiency, and minimize financial losses. 
This study focuses on analyzing historical flight delay data to identify key patterns and develop predictive models. 
By leveraging data analytics and machine learning, the study aims to provide insights that can help airlines, air traffic controllers, and policymakers make informed decisions to mitigate delays and improve the overall efficiency of air travel.

A comparative study was done on the basis of the following models:
1. Linear Regressor
2. Random Forest Regressor
3. Artificial Neural Netowrk
4. XGBoost Regressor

The best model was concluded to be XGBoost Regressor which had the least error and highest R2-Score.
